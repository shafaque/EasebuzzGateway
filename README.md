# Sample App for PaywithEaseBuzz Android SDK Implementation

This project demonstrates how to integrate the **PaywithEaseBuzz** Android SDK for handling payments using Easebuzz's `PWECouponsActivity` in an Android application built with Jetpack Compose.

## Features
- **Jetpack Compose** based UI.
- Activity result handling using `rememberLauncherForActivityResult`.
- Integration of Easebuzz's `PWECouponsActivity` for payment processing.
- Edge-to-edge UI design enabled for modern Android devices.

## Project Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone or download the project files to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/example/sample-gateway.git
```

### 2. Add PaywithEaseBuzz SDK

#### a. Add `peb-lib-android-x.aar` to Your Project
- Copy the `peb-lib-android-x.aar` file into the `app/libs/` folder.
- If the `libs` folder does not exist, create it manually within the `app` directory.

#### b. Modify ProGuard Rules
If you are using ProGuard for code obfuscation, add the following rule to your `proguard-rules.pro` file to ensure that the Easebuzz SDK classes are not obfuscated:

```pro
-keepclassmembers class com.easebuzz.payment.kit.** {
    *;
}
```

#### c. Modify `build.gradle.kts` (Module: app)

1. **Add `libs` folder as a repository:**

   In the `repositories` section of your `build.gradle.kts` (Module: app), add the following lines:

   ```kotlin
   repositories {
       flatDir {
           dirs("libs") // To access the AAR file
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Add SDK dependency:**

   In the `dependencies` section of the same `build.gradle.kts` file, add:

   ```kotlin
   dependencies {
       implementation(name = "peb-lib-android-x", ext = "aar") // Ensure the correct version of the AAR file is used
   }
   ```

   Replace `x` with the appropriate version number provided by Easebuzz.

### 3. Sync Your Project
After making the necessary changes to your `build.gradle.kts` file, sync the project to ensure all dependencies are resolved.

### 4. Customization
- Replace the placeholder `"Access key generated by the Initiate Payment API"` with your actual access key obtained from the Easebuzz payment gateway.
- Configure the `"pay_mode"` to `"test"` or `"production"` depending on your environment.

## Requirements
- **Android API Level:** 21 or higher.
- **Jetpack Compose:** Ensure your project is set up to support Jetpack Compose.
- **Easebuzz Payment Kit:** Integration with the Easebuzz Payment Gateway SDK.

## License
This project is for demonstration purposes. Ensure compliance with Easebuzz's terms and conditions when using the SDK in production environments.
